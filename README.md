# Personal Wiki with Gatsby

In an attempt to do more learning in public this year, I made myself a personal wiki/notebook of sorts. Ideally, I'd like to use these notes for my own personal reference, and having them all in one place, makes it a bit easier for me to find them and read them later down the road (as opposed to looking through a million post-it's I've chucked into my drawer).
