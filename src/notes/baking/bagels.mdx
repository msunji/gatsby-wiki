Quick notes about common issues that I've run into (mostly for personal reference).

1. **Bagel crust gets too soft the day after**

- Try freezing bagels after they've cooled to room temp (after baking).

2. **Crust looks a bit _too_ rough**

- Possibly caused by poor gluten development (not kneaded enough).

3. **Bagels stick to surface while proofing (pre-bagel baptism)**

- Try using semolina or a light coating of oil on your pan/tray/whatever you're proofing your bagels on to prevent bagels from sticking.
- Other options: silpat mat? cutting the parchment and then dunking the bagel AND parchment paper into the bagel bath water?

4. **Bagels turn out flatter than you'd like**

- As it turns out, it's possible that your bagels are overproofed. During the proofing stage, you'll want to make sure that your bagels feel lighter and have doubled in size.
- With that in mind, don't boil them for too long. I personally prefer ~20-30 seconds per side.
