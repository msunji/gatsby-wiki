I've eaten a fair amount of pies in my life, but that's come to a bit of an abrupt stop since moving for grad school. Where I live, store bought pie crust isn't exactly easily available, so I decided I'd try making it myself from scratch.

Pie crust, when broken down, really isn't that complicated. Flour, water, and some sort of fat like butter or shortening, and you've got it. Making it on the other hand...isn't what I'd call the easiest for a pie making beginner such as myself. Here's a run down of what went down when I attempted pie crusts.

## Take One - _Not too bad_

I used this [Serious Eats article](https://www.seriouseats.com/easy-pie-dough-recipe) as my point of reference. I ran into a tiny bit of trouble when I realised that my food processor was a bit too small to get the job done in one go. I ended up having to split the ingredients in half and doing a batch at a time before combining everything in a bowl and adding water to get the dough to come together.

Next, I refrigerated the dough for about 2 hours, then had it sit on the counter for ~10 minutes before rolling it out. The dough, overall, was easy to work with, but it did tear a tiny bit. The end result was flaky enough, thought it didn't have distinct layers that you'd typically associate with a proper flaky pie crust.

## Take Two - _I prefer not to talk about this_

Frankly, THIS WAS EMBARRASSING ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­. For my second attempt, I tried a different method of putting the dough together. I did everything by hand instead of using a stand mixer. But after letting it rest in the fridge for a bit, everything kind of went downhill from there. First, despite resting in the fridge for about an hour or so, the dough was incredibly crumbly, likely lacking a bit of moisture in the mix. I didn't really know you could still add water at this point, so I just went on with it until the butter melted completely ðŸ¥². I was left with an extremely crumbly, _can't-really-call-this-pie-crust_ crust.

## Lessons Learned and Things to Try

- When they say work quickly, _work quickly_.
- If your pie dough breaks when you roll it out, try sprinkling some cold water on to the dough and _gently_ work it in.
- Be sure that your dough doesn't get too warm!
- Try [Claire Saffitz' method?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLxGcFr93TM)
- Try using shortening next time? It's got a higher melting point
