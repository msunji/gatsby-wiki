title: Learning Japanese through video games

I've been an on-and-off learner of Japanese. I did classes for less than a year whilst in university, but it's since been a self-motivated effort. I've not had the best luck with more traditional methods of learning a new language, so I thought I'd give video games a try.

## What I'm playing

I recently finished all the mainline RGG Studio games, so I picked up Yakuza Ishin (龍が如く　維新！) not too long ago to scratch the _"I need more Yakuza games to play"_ itch. The problem is, it's all in Japanese. And though the game's been out for quite some time now, localisation plans haven't really been set in stone. So instead of waiting for it to be released in English, I thought this would be the perfect opportunity for me to do some self-studying.

## How it's coming along

The first week was a bit rough, cognitively speaking. Armed with a pen, several sheets of paper, and [jisho.org](jisho.org) on my phone, I spent half of the time pausing my game to find the definitions of words and grammar patterns.

It got a bit better as I played more of the game (so far, I've been playing it about two or more hours a night), since I ended up kind of going through some sort of spaced-repetition exercise just by playing the game regularly. Certain words and patterns do come up quite often, and after a while, you begin to realise you do actually get what they're saying. And my oh my, is it a wonderful feeling.

## Is this method effective?

It's a bit too early to tell at this point, so I'll get back to this note when I've finished the game.
