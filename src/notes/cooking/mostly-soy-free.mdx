Notes, recipes, and other bits of info to help me with my soy sensitivity.

## Pixian doubanjiang (fermented bean paste)

Doubanjiang made in Sichuan province is traditionally made out of broad beans instead of soybeans.

## Mapo "tofu"

- Use Pixian doubanjiang as your base, instead of the regular stuff
- To make faux silken tofu, you can combine chicken stock and eggs. The amount of eggs to stock/water should be a (roughly) 1:1 ratio. Mix well and steam. You're essentially making something like _chawanmushi_.

## Other alternatives I'd like to check out

- Burmese tofu (made out of chickpeas)
