I've made bagels a handful of times now, but still haven't quite gotten it down pat. Here are some quick notes about common issues that I've run into (mostly for personal reference).

1. **Bagel crust gets too soft the day after**

- Try freezing them after cooling to room temp.

2. **Bagel crust just doesn't have that trademark sheen**

- Overproofing can cause your bagels to lose air, leaving you with a matte crust.

3. **Crust looks a bit _too_ rough**

- Possibly caused by poor gluten development (not kneaded enough).

3. **Bagels stick to surface while proofing (pre-bagel baptism)**

- Try using semolina on the surface to prevent bagels from sticking.

4. **Bagels turn out flatter than you'd like**

- As it turns out, it's possible that your bagels are overproofed.
- With that in mind, don't boil them for too long. I personally prefer ~20-30 seconds per side.
