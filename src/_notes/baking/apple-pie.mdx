## Filling

Adapted from [this recipe](https://cookingformysoul.com/classic-apple-pie-precooked-apple-filling/).

- Apples (cored, sliced)
- 100g brown sugar
- Spices (cinnamon, all spice, grated ginger)
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 14g butter
- Zest of 1 lemon
- 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice
- 1-2 tbsp cornstarch

You basically want to combine everything except the cornstarch and then cook it on the stove until the apples soften. You'll then want to add cornstarch and cook for another couple of minutes until the filling starts to thicken.

Made the apple pie filling ahead of time (the day before) using Aomori Orin Apples (青森王林). I used four apples which weighed roughly 200g each (uncored).

A bit about apples and apple pie filling:

- Orin apples are a cross between Golden Delicious and Indo varieties
  - Arguably one of the better apple varieties to use for filling (see [this Serious Eats article](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab-what-are-the-best-apples-for-apple-pies-how-to-make-pie))
- I brought the pie filling out ahead of time to get it to room temperature before filling the pie for baking.

## Baking

- Used a milk wash with brown sugar sprinkled on top. End product looked ever so slightly anaemic, but brown enough to look cooked through.
- Baked in a Pyrex pie dish (around 9"/22.9 cm) set on top of a baking sheet, and baked on the second to the last oven rack at 215C for 25 minutes
  - I ended up adding an extra ~10 minutes at 200C to get the top to brown a bit more (eventually coming to realise why people use pie crust shileds)
- Bottom crust was a tiny bit soggy and could have been a bit more browned. Overall, the crust was cooked through though.

## For Next Time

- I really could have made more filling
  - Sort out the crust-to-filling ratio
  - Try chunks instead of slices
- Invest in a pie crust shield (or aluminium foil) to prevent edges from browning too much
- Work on pie crust crimping (made the edges a bit too thick!)
